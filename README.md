# anadmin
Set of bash scripts for sysadmin i developed for [Academia Nacional de Ajedrez](https://anaj.org.ve/) (Chess National Academy).

I'm trying to be modular and easy to ready code so my organization of files are simple so far:

<pre><code>
.
├── lib                    < stand alone and common scripts
├── some_bash_script.sh    < hihg level scripts
└── wip                    < work in progress scripts (developing)
</code></pre>
